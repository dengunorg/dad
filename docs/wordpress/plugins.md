# WordPress Plugins

Our recommendation of plugins, explained.

## Manage page options and data: ACF — Advanced Custom Fields

Possibly the most essential plugin for WordPress development. It has:

- easy metadata management
- convenient widgets for data management
- option page management
- post type creator

## SEO

Our SEO team's preferred SEO plugin is Yoast SEO.

## Translation

We recommend **WPML**. It's easier to handle translations, and less prone to create unused content.

As an alternative, there's Translatepress, ideal for smaller projects and for when the translation user experience is prioritized (over managing content per language).

## Page Builder

When Wordpress's Full-Site Editor isn't enough:

- Elementor (Preferred) — an enhanced page builder experience
- GenerateBlocks — for more processing-heavy sites (e.g.: news sites)

## Form Builder

[Formidable Forms](https://formidableforms.com/) is ideal when Elementor's default form does not apply

## E-mail management (incl. leads)

- [FluentSMTP](https://fluentsmtp.com/) — check emails sent and received

## Content management

- [Duplicate page](https://wordpress.org/plugins/duplicate-page/) — for when even copy-paste is too much work...

## Data Migration

- [Better Search and Replace](https://bettersearchreplace.com/) — useful to update page and media links when migrating environments (e.g.: from staging to production)

## Development/Local Setup

- Updraft Plus — load and save databases, useful to set up local projects
- Query Monitor — high-quality debugger, with info on query load, memory usage, and backend information
- [FakerPress](https://wordpress.org/plugins/fakerpress/) — create fake data on the fly
