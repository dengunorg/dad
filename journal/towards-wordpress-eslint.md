# The journey to configure CodeSniffer, Wordpress's ESLint-Prettier setup

## Why do we need one of these ESLint-Prettier things?

- formatting standard
- readable enough, without having to configure it
- prevent common mistakes (e.g.: unused variables, global wp variables, wrong translation domain, variables in
  translation functions, unescaped functions...)
- Good luck with code reviews!

## Oh great, there's a STANDARD...

## ... but the standard has ISSUES!
