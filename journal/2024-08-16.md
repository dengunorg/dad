# Weekly Adventures

## Git worktree is pretty cool

Kinda like a combination of git switch and git clone. Might be my new weapon of choice for hotfixes during development.

## Check your WWWs

Something very important when **releasing a website**: make sure the domain is properly set (with `www.` if so included,
it usually does).
This week, one such issue caused the following problems:

- CORS issues with some resources (usually fonts, and some of them weren't in staging)
- Inability to enabledisable plugins (like WP-Rocket, and Elementor Pro, whose account wasn't activable)
- Inability to log in after logging out (had to do a password reset)
- Inability to open Elementor editor
- Wordpress admin bar (on top) wasn't displayed on pages overall (even after logging in)

So, if you come across one or more of these issues, please check the Release Guide (in a possible section including
Symptoms of an erroneous release).
