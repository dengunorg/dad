# Articles/posts I've found useful this week

## Please be safe

**Topics**: *Wordpress*, *Security*

A [study from PatchStack](https://patchstack.com/whitepaper/state-of-wordpress-security-in-2024/) emphasizes a strong correlation between WordPress Plugins and security issues:

> Plugins were responsible for 97% of all new security vulnerabilities

> Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) accounted for 53.3% of all new security vulnerabilities found in the WordPress ecosystem."

> It’s becoming evident that relying on malware scanning with WordPress security plugins is fundamentally broken and even creates a false sense of security. Hackers infect websites with malware that turns these security plugins off

This is a great reminder to to select plugins carefully, and to ensure that the theme and plugins are regularly updated. Additionally, when **developing custom code**, always make sure to **sanitize user content** from forms, or even translation files — hint: use CodeSniffer with Wordpress Coding Standards to enforce this!

Other security tips include [disabling file editing in the backoffice](https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-tutorials/how-to-disable-theme-and-plugin-editors-from-wordpress-admin-panel/), and changing the login url.

## Grouping custom metadata with Advanced Custom Fields (ACF)

Did you know about **[ACF's Tabs](https://www.advancedcustomfields.com/resources/tab/)**?

Tabs are very useful to group existing fields in ACF Field Groups. This is because, unlike an [ACF Group](https://www.advancedcustomfields.com/resources/group/), it does NOT change existing field's name (so you won't lose existing data because a field name's changed).

This helps us "respond to change over following a plan" (the 4th principle of the [Agile Manifesto](https://agilemanifesto.org/))!

## Redirects are important, but to be handled with care

The ability to make "redirects" is a great power that comes with great responsibility.
This week, there was an issue caused by a redirect rule, which prevented users from accessing specific pages.

Fortunately, the team was able to respond quickly without dire consequences.
