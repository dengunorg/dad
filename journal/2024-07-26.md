## I was working with Elementor all wrong...

I always thought that writing pages with Elementor was VERY unintuitive, especially because of the process:

1. Create a page (Wordpress)
2. Create a page template specific for that page
3. Edit the template, NOT the page

But can't I select the page itself and then click the "Edit with Elementor" button? Yes, but then this error occurred:
> Post Content widget not found

Apparently, this was because I still didn't have a generic template (applicable for all pages by default), with the Page
Content Widget. So here's what I did: I **created an empty page template, added the Post Content widget to it, and then
configured it to be used by all pages by default (which don't have a specific template).
And now, I can press "Edit with Elementor" instead of selecting the "Single Page" template!

Elementor's still very confusing, though...

For detailed info on this issue, see
its [official troubleshooting entry](https://elementor.com/help/post-content-widget-not-found/)

## Post content's custom block styles

I learned how to register an existing Gutenberg Block's custom style (which also applies to a modern theme's post
content). I was motivated due to wanting paragraphs with a
specific style, which could be used in a post's content (which uses gutenberg blocks).

The following resources were useful:

- (Recommended): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AR4c3BhZr1M
- https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/reference-guides/block-api/block-styles/ — register a block on the
  client's side
- https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/functions/register_block_style/ — to do it server-side

## Charts and Spreadsheets

- https://www.chartjs.org/docs/latest/samples/animations/progressive-line.html — example of a line graph
- https://chartjs-plugin-datalabels.netlify.app/guide/ — when you want to add labels to your pie chart
- https://github.com/peopledoc/django-chartjs — there's even a django app

Loading data from a Google spreadsheet is easy... with a guide!

Also, does anyone know what a `wp_remote_get` is? My CodeSniffer configuration recommended using this over `curl_get`.
This is one of the reasons why I recommend linters for beginners: they highlight best practices you might not know
about, and which you might or not agree with.

Maybe we should add this to our release checklist? What about 3rd-party stuff that might... require stuff?
